Image Recognition - Multiclass Classification: detecting Covid-19 from lung scans.
The detection of Covid-19 and other types of pneumonia is carried out by training and testing different versions of a baseline feedforward neural network. Hyperparameter tuninung is performed manually at first, and in an automated fashion using Talos Tuner. 
Provided that the data at hand suffers from class imabalance for the target category of pneumonia (Covid-19), the comparison between different versions of the neural network relies on the F1 metric and the Receiver Operator Characteristic variant for multiclass classification and its respective Area Under the Curve (AUC). 
Results are reported in the final report named Deep Learning Assignment. 
For the code see DL_Assignment_FINAL.ipynb.
